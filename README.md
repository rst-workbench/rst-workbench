# rst-workbench

<img align="left" src="frontend/img/logo.png" width="300"> The `rst-workbench` lets you easily
install and run existing RST parsers usind Docker containers.
It provides a convenient web app for running multiple RST parsers concurrently
and allows you to visualize and post-edit the trees produced by the parsers.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zpdhp5nu-M) demonstrating its usage.  
You can also try our demo server at https://rst-workbench.arne.cl/.

## Supported Parsers

Currently, we support the following RST parsers that we provide as Docker
containers with a REST API and pre-trained on RST-DT:

- HILDA (Hernault et al. 2010) [[our repo](https://github.com/nlpbox/hilda-service)] [[paper](http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/dad/article/download/591/591-2300-1-PB.pdf)]
  - HILDA itself is only available from the [Prendinger lab](http://research.nii.ac.jp/%7Eprendinger/),
    so we can't provide automated builds but only the build scripts here.

- Feng and Hirst (2014) [[our repo](https://github.com/NLPbox/feng-hirst-service)] [[paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1048/)]

- DPLP (Ji and Eisenstein 2014) [[our repo](https://github.com/NLPbox/dplp-service)] [[paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1002/)]

- Heilman and Sagae (2015) [[our repo](https://github.com/NLPbox/heilman-sagae-2015-service)] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02425)]

- CODRA (Joty et al. 2015) [[our repo](https://github.com/NLPbox/codra-service)] [[paper](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/COLI_a_00226)]

- StageDP (Wang et al. 2017) [[our repo](https://github.com/nlpbox/stagedp-service)] [[paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-2029/)]
  - the parser requires EDU-segmented input, so we combine it with the NeuralEDUSeg discourse segmenter [(Wang et al. 2018)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1116/)


## Installation

Please install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) first,
then clone this repo including its submodules.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rst-workbench/rst-workbench
```


### Usage on your local machine

To run the rst-workbench on your local machine, simply run  
`DOMAIN=localhost docker compose up --build --force-recreate` in the folder into which you cloned the repo.  

On the first run, this will take a long time and download the Docker containers of all supported RST parsers.  
On all subsequent runs, this will be much quicker and simply start the Docker containers from your hard drive.

Once it has started, go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to use the web interface.

By setting set the `DOMAIN` to `localhost`, the rst-workbench will be only available on the
machine where you run this command. The parameters `--build` and `--force-recreate` should
not be needed on normal runs, but you will need them whenever you change the configuration.

  
### Usage on a server

The repo contains everything necessary to run our demo server at https://rst-workbench.arne.cl/ .
We usually start it like this:

```
DOMAIN=rst-workbench.arne.cl docker compose -f docker-compose-server.yml up --build --force-recreate
```

To make it work on your domain, you will need to change the `domains` and `email` variables
in the file `nginx-certbot/init-letsencrypt.sh`.
